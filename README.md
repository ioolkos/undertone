## About [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

This is a project for making music in LFE, with support for MIDI, audio
processing, Open Sound Control, and more. The `undertone` project relies
heavily upon the phenomenal work of [Andrew Sorensen](https://github.com/digego)
et al in the [Extempore project](https://github.com/digego/extempore),
essentially having the aim of providing an LFE DSL for BEAM-native, distributed
interaction with Extempore.

SuperCollider support is currently limited to basic OSC operations. Features for
that or orhter backends or additing new backends to undertone will be
prioritised based upon time and interest.

## Build and Test [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

```shell
$ rebar3 compile
$ rebar3 ltest # this step is optional
$ rebar3 release
```

## Usage Overview [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

For the examples below, start the REPL:

```shell
$ rebar3 repl
```

Note that, while under active development, the undertone logging level will be
set to `debug`. If that's too much for you, before you start the REPL edit the
`./config/sys.config` file and change the logging level entries to `notice` or
`warning`.

### Working with Extempore [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

Tested against `extempore` version `0.8.7`.

Download the latest Extempore from the
[project releases](https://github.com/digego/extempore/releases)
page on Github.

Assuming you've started `extempore` and have the LFE REPL running, as above,
you will have been automatically connected to the Extempore TCP server. As
such, you're ready to start living coding!

There are two ways to do this right now:

1. from LFE (in LFE syntax), and
1. within an LFE-managed REPL supporting native Extempore syntax

#### From LFE

Note that only a limited number of Exempore forms are supported from within LFE
right now.

Load the appropriate Extempore files into the server and the LFE macros into the
current REPL session:

``` lisp
(xt:sys-load "examples/sharedsystem/setup.xtm")
(include-lib "undertone/include/xt-patterns.lfe")
```

Play an ascending scale using the second synthesizer that comes with Extempore:

``` lisp
(/> 'ascending-scale 4 0 (play 'syn2 '@1 80 'dur) (scale 4 8))
```

Note that the Extempore syntax for this is `:>`, a character combination not
supported in LFE symbols, so `/>` was settled upon instead. Similarly, below you
will see `//` used in LFE as an analog for the `:|` used in Extempore.

Then change the tempo:

``` lisp
(set-tempo! 72)
```

You can stop the synth in two ways -- changing 'play' form to the 'stop' form
while keeping the remaining body the same (this is useful for live coding
scenarios): 
``` lisp
(// 'ascending-scale 4 0 (play 'syn2 '@1 80 'dur) (scale 4 8))
```

or by calling the 'stop' form using just the pattern name you
defined in the 'play' form:

``` lisp
(// 'ascending-scale)
```

#### The Extempore REPL

At the LFE prompt, start up the Extempore REPL:

``` lisp
lfe> (undertone.repl.extempore:start)
extempore> 
```

Once at the `extempore>` prompt, you will be able to enter native Extempore
expressions (Scheme and xtlang). These will be passed to the Extempore TCP
server as-is (executed asynchronously and non-blocking).

Additionally, you may call other supported functions. To see the list of
supported REPL function, type `(help)`:

``` lisp
extempore> (help)
```

``` text
The Extempore undertone REPL

Built-in functions:

(call body) -- make an explicitly blocking call to Extempore, with 'body' being
               a valid Extempore expression
(check-xt)  -- check on the status of Extempore (no response indicates a health
               problem, possibly requiring a restart of the 'extempore' binary)
(eom)       -- alias for '(term)'
(exit)      -- alias for '(quit)'
(h)         -- alias for '(help)'
(help)      -- display this information
(quit)      -- quit the Extempore REPL and return to the LFE REPL
(run file)  -- load the code in the given file and run in Extempore
(term)      -- send message-terminating character sequence to force Extempore
               end-of-message (useful when troubleshooting)
(version)   -- display all the version info for undertone

Extempore support:

All S-expressions other than the ones listed above will be treated as Extempore
Scheme / xtlang code and sent to the Extempore TCP server (compiler service) as
an asynchronous call (no result, no output printed). If you would like to block
on particular calls and see their return values, be sure to use the '(call ...)'
REPL function.
```

### OSC [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

#### The Erlang Server [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

Tested against `erlsci/osc` `2.0` and `2.1`.

``` lisp
lfe> (set c (undertone.osc.client:connect "localhost" 2357))
; ok#(client #Pid<0.276.0> #Pid<0.277.0>)
lfe> (undertone.osc.client:echo c)
; ok
```

If you view the output of the running Erlang OSC server, you should see some
debug output logged:

```
=INFO REPORT==== 27-Nov-2020::16:14:05.986773 ===
Received message: []
```

You can also check passed arguements:

``` lisp
lfe> (undertone.osc.client:echo c '(a list of args))
ok
```

```
=INFO REPORT==== 27-Nov-2020::16:35:28.652299 ===
Received message: [a,list,'of',args]
```

#### SuperCollider [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

Tested against SuperCollider `3.11.2`.

#### Connecting

Start up the SuperCollider GUI / IDE, then in the editor enter the following:

```
s.options.maxLogins = 8;
s.reboot;
Server.default.options.asOptionsString
```

The last line will help you confirm the current settings, showing what they
would be if you'd started `scsynth` manually. In particular, you want to confirm
that you see `-l 8`.

Then, in a terminal at the LFE REPL:

``` lisp
lfe> (set c (sc.client:connect "localhost" 57110))
;#(client #Pid<0.344.0> #Pid<0.345.0>)
```

Once the client is set up, do a quick check to see that you are connected to the
right server / version and that there are synthesizer definitions loaded:

``` lisp
lfe> (sc.client:version c)
;(#(version "3.11.2") #(branch "HEAD") #(commit-id "9a34118e"))

lfe> (sc.client:status c)
;(#(unit-generators 0)
; #(synths 0)
; #(gruops 9)
; #(loaded-synth-definitions 106)
; #(cpu-average-usage 0.030904095619916916)
; #(cpu-peak-usage 0.2695612609386444)
; #(nominal-sample-rate 4.41e4)
; #(actual-sample-rate 44099.98856935304))
```

#### Playing Sounds

First create a handful of instances of the default synth and then stop them,
until we're ready:

``` lisp
lfe> (set synth-ids '(1000 1001 1002 1003 1004))
;"ϨϩϪϫϬ"
lfe> (set (list s0 s1 s2 s3 s4) (list-comp
       ((<- id synth-ids))
       (sc.client:create-synth c id)))
;"ϨϩϪϫϬ"
lfe> (list-comp ((<- id synth-ids)) (sc.client:stop-node c id))
;(ok ok ok ok ok)
```

Instead of a boring C chord, let's take some notes from the C scale's Locrian
mode using `B`, `E`, `F`, `A`, and `B` (a combination _rarely_ heard!):

``` lisp
lfe> (include-lib "include/notes.lfe")
;|-- loaded include: notes --|
lfe> (sc.client:set-node c s0 `("freq" ,(B3) out 0))
;ok
lfe> (sc.client:set-node c s1 `("freq" ,(E3) out 1))
;ok
lfe> (sc.client:set-node c s2 `("freq" ,(F3) out 0))
;ok
lfe> (sc.client:set-node c s3 `("freq" ,(A3) out 0))
;ok
lfe> (sc.client:set-node c s4 `("freq" ,(B4) out 1))
;ok
```

Now play them all:

``` lisp
lfe> (list-comp ((<- id synth-ids)) (sc.client:start-node c id))
;(ok ok ok ok ok)
```

For the MIDI-minded, in addition to the `notes.lfe` include, there is a
`midi-notes.lfe` file with functions defined for getting notes by MIDI number.

And then, when you're done listening to that beautiful dissonance:

``` lisp
lfe> (list-comp ((<- id synth-ids)) (sc.client:stop-node c id))
;(ok ok ok ok ok)
```

#### Ardour [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

``` lisp
lfe> (set c (ardour.client:connect "localhost" 3819))
;#(client #Pid<0.281.0> #Pid<0.282.0>)
lfe> (ardour.client:strip-list c)
;(#(name "SynthMaster One")
; #(strip-number 1)
; #(type "MIDI track")
; #(inputs 0)
; #(outputs 2)
; #(muted? 0)
; #(soloed? 0)
; #(record-enabled? 0))
```
