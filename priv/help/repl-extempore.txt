The Extempore undertone REPL

Built-in functions:

(call body) -- make an explicitly blocking call to Extempore, with 'body' being
               a valid Extempore expression
(check-xt)  -- check on the status of Extempore (no response indicates a health
               problem, possibly requiring a restart of the 'extempore' binary)
(eom)       -- alias for '(term)'
(exit)      -- alias for '(quit)'
(h)         -- alias for '(help)'
(help)      -- display this information
(load file) -- read the code in the given file and load in the current Extempore
               session
(quit)      -- quit the Extempore REPL and return to the LFE REPL
(term)      -- send message-terminating character sequence to force Extempore
               end-of-message (useful when troubleshooting)
(v)         -- alias for '(version)'
(version)   -- display all the version info for undertone

Extempore support:

All S-expressions other than the ones listed above will be treated as Extempore
Scheme / xtlang code and sent to the Extempore TCP server (compiler service) as
an asynchronous call (no result, no output printed). If you would like to block
on particular calls and see their return values, be sure to use the '(call ...)'
REPL function.
